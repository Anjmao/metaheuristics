Implementation of a few metaheuristics in C#
============================================

This project was created by [Ariel Hernández Amador][gnuaha7] and [Yasser González Fernández][ygf] in fulfillment of the final assignment of an undergraduate course on metaheuristics for Computer Science students taught at the University of Havana, Cuba. That is why the git comments were written in Spanish.

The assignment consisted in a competition where each team had to implement a group of metaheuristics to solve four well-known discrete optimization problems. All the algorithms were run in a group of benchmark problems and the teams were ranked according to the results achieved by their algorithms. Both the number of metaheuristics implemented by the team and the results of the algorithms were considered for the assessment. So, each team had to implement a wide range of metaheuristics and to achieve good results. By the way, we got the first place in the competition!

The metaheuristics are:

* Genetic Algorithm (GA),
* Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP),
* Iterated Local Search (ILS),
* Memetic Algorithms (MA),
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
* Simulated Annealing (SA),
* Scatter Search (SS),
* Tabu Search (TS),
* Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm (UMDA),
* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),
* and a few Hybrid Metaheuristics (HM).

The problems are:

* Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
* Set Partition Problem (SPP),
* Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
* and 2-Dimensional Strip Packing (2SP).
